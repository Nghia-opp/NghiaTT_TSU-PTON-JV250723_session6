    <p class="main"><b>This is the first item`s accordion body.</b> 
        It is shown by default, until the collapse
        plugin adds the appropriate classes that we
         use to style each element. These classes control
         the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via css 
         transitions. You can modifi any of this with custom CSS or
         overriding our default variables. It`s also worth noting
         that just about any HTML can go within the <span class="pink">.accordion-body</span>, 
         though the transition does limit overflow.
